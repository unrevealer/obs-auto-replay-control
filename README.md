# obs-auto-replay-control
This script for OBS Studio takes a name as an input for a Game Capture source in the current active scene. It will then automatically enable or disable the OBS Replay Buffer feature when the Game Capture source has hooked or unhooked a game window. This eliminates the need to manually control the Replay Buffer where it may prevent certain system tasks such as putting a Windows system to sleep while the buffer is active.
